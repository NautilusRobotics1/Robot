OpenCV Meeting Notes:

Blob Detection
Sharpening -> When Matching Objects

Note: RGB will be different underwater (i.e. extra blue in the blue channel)

Currently the test pictures have light source problem

To test more aggresively:
  Add new exaggerationover the light source
  Maybe add blue & green for testing (from the light source / post processing)

Noe: If the distance away from the target is known the pixel# will be known and easier to match to training images

Preferred openCV on Laptop is good because of accuracy and latency
From RaspberryPi, then if the video feed stream is compressed (more overhead)

Greyscale = is a standard scaled by specific amounts but weights might change the true colors in the image
  For the math, check MATLab's rgb2grey

Try to partition a partition
  Original for chars
  New for shapes

_Needs_
  ink / color / font / print surface

Color Stock (i.e. macbeth chart)
  Threshold it from outside & inside water, to fine tune for live vide feed

Cameras have an effect on the true image:
  Exposure: Auto exposure problems
  Sharpening: May add contrast pixels at edges
